	Like with any supplementation, go slowly and build up. If you have

	start with with the Gold programs for the first week. Start with
	PURE from the Gold program. Later on you could do RELEASE, also from
	the Gold program. Use the gold program for the first week to get
	your body used to the frequencies. (PURE can create detox.)<BR><BR>The
	second week you can build up to two gold programs and one program of
	your choice. Don't use too close to bedtime, unless it's a sleep
	program, since some Healy programs give you energy.<BR><BR>6.
	DOCUMENT your sessions&mdash;what you did and the results. Rate your

				<H2 CLASS="western" STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in">From a
				Health Practitioner:<BR>&#8203;I would recommend two products
				one, a good trace mineral product and two, A hydration product.
				There are plenty of good ones on the market I&rsquo;m sure you
				could recommend them to her. Her mineral status is probably the
				biggest issue she&rsquo;s probably been dehydrated for so long
				that the aqua Porins in on the surface of her cells are shut down
				to protect from becoming totally dehydrated. It&rsquo;s a
				survival response of our cells when they have not received
				adequate hydration for months or years. Because of this there is
				not good electrolyte exchange of sodium potassium chloride and
				magnesium which means that her cells are not detoxing properly.
				The lymphatic enhancement technology that I&rsquo;m doing with
				her is helping opening up her lymphatic channels and drainage
				pathways, but there is a lot of gunk to pull out of her cells.
				It&rsquo;s just going to take time. However after a week or so of
				being on these two products she should notice being more in the
				white than the black.<BR>~~~~~~<BR>Black means not good
				conductivity but it doesn't mean it's not working. The person may
				need water, minerals or skin hydration, like using aloe or a
				moisturizer on the place where the wrist straps are and they need
				to be fairly tight to make a good connection.</H2>
